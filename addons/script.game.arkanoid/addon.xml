Known bugs should be corrected on the next release.
 - The ball can sometimes passed through a indestructible block "Gold" and stuck the other side.
   the only solution for now is to leave the script and start again

 - Again the ball sometimes it is bounded and turn around but the angle changes slowly and it feels it is taken,
   then the only solution for the impatient like me , is out of the script and start again
